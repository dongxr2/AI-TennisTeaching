This repository is associated with the paper titled "AI-Powered Intelligent Tennis Coaching: Enhancing Personalized Instruction with Lightweight Temporal Network and LLMs on Low-Cost Hardware". 

This paper presents a Lightweight Temporal Network for Tennis Error Detection, which identifies irregular movements during the tennis stroke process, and on this basis, develops an intelligent tennis coaching system that seamlessly fuses visual AI and LLMs tech-nologies on an affordable Raspberry Pi 5 hardware platform. 

The complete source code and video dataset used in the experiments will be made publicly available upon the paper's acceptance.
